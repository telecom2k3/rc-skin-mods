# rc-skin-mods
These are slight mods, mostly to the core "Larry" skin, that will display the Sender in a dark blue color, making it easier to quickly differentiate the sender from the recipient.  These are some of the "free" skins that I use: Core, the Mabola's, the Chameleon's, and those published by texxasrulez: https://github.com/texxasrulez/Roundcube_Skins

This was based upon popular request from my users.

<b>Requirements</b>
---
PHP 5.6 or 7.2<br>
Roundcube: 1.3.X

<b>Installation</b>
Unzip these into your Roundcube "/skins" folder.

<b>Support</b>
---
Offered as is with no support. I do not wish to become "Mr. CSS".  Backup your original Roundcube "/skins" folder before installing these.  Tweak them to your satisfaction.
